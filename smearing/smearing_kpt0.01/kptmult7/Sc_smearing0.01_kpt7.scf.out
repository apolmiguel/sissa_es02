!    total energy              =    -306.87289314 Ry
     total all-electron energy =     -3050.013664 Ry
     estimated scf accuracy    <          1.1E-11 Ry
     smearing contrib. (-TS)   =      -0.00014953 Ry
     internal energy E=F+TS    =    -306.87274361 Ry

     The total energy is F=E-TS. E is the sum of the following terms:
     one-electron contribution =     -74.40640096 Ry
